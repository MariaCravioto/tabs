        <p>And you know sometimes words have two meanings in the tree by the brook</p>
        <p>there's a songbird who sings sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiving</p>
        <p>Uh, makes me wonder,uh, makes me wonder.</p>
        <p>There's a feeling I get when I look to the west and my spirit is crying for leaving</p>
        <p>In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees</p>

          <p>And the voices of those who stand looking</p>
          <p>Uh, makes me wonder,uh, makes me wonder.</p>
          <p>And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune</p>
          <p>Then the piper will lead us to reason and a new day will<p>
          <p>dawn for those who stand long and the forest will echo with laughter</p>
